 Fractional Wavelet Filter
 (FrWF) emerges as a groundbreaking solution to address the
 memory constraints posed by traditional Discrete Wavelet
 Transform (DWT). FrWF reimagines the signal processing
 landscape by introducing an innovative approach that leverages
 external memory for storage and computation, minimizing
 memory overhead while maintaining accurate signal analysis.
 This distinctive characteristic positions FrWF as an ideal low
memory alternative, especially crucial in resource-constrained
environments where memory availability is limited
